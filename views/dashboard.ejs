						The RSC Development League is a Rocket League competitive league that runs concurrently to the 
						active RSC season. It is open to <strong>ALL RSC players</strong> and is intended to let
						Free Agents showcase their skills and capabilities to GMs and franchise staff. Dev League matches
						also have game stats and generate SBV/IDR during the season just like rostered players!
					</p>

					<h3>Dev League Info</h3>
					<p>
						Players currently rostered inside of RSC Franchises are also <strong>strongly</strong>
						encouraged to sign up and play as a sub so that we can ensure we have enough players in each tier
						to have at least two teams playing every night. Free agents will always receive priority in being placed 
						on a team, but anyone that signs up as a sub will be used on a first-come, first-served basis as needed
						to fill out teams.
					</p>
					<p>
						Games run every Monday and Wednesday night on active game days at <strong>8:00PM ET</strong> 
						and are <strong>ALWAYS</strong> finished before 9:00PM
						so that you can sub for active franchises if needed. If you wish to play tonight, please check in by clicking
						the button below (must be signed in with your Discord account). 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Be aware...</strong> the RSC Development League is for FAs to get seen by GMs/AGMs/Scouts. 
						Players checking in and then choosing at the last minute not to play hurts our ability to 
						provide this service. Only check in if you're 100% committed to playing a series of 4 games
						at 8:15PM. <strong>If you check in and no-show your matches, you will be banned from Dev League
						for the rest of the current season.</strong>
